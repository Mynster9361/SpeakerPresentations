    Hello there! I'm **Morten Mynster**, an automation enthusiast, coder, and proud family man. My IT journey began back in 2017, and since then, I've been on a mission to simplify the complex through scripting and automation. Whether it's crafting workflows, managing systems, or experimenting with new technologies, I thrive on turning challenges into opportunities for innovation.

When I'm not writing code or tinkering in my homelab, I'm spending time with my amazing wife, our two kids, and our Disney-inspired dog, Mushu (yes, like the dragon from *Mulan*). Outside of work, you'll find me gaming, exploring new ideas, or enjoying quality time with my family.

### What I Work On
I dedicate my time to mastering:
- **PowerShell**: Automating tasks, managing systems, and making the impossible possible.
- **Python**: Building robust scripts and developing creative automation solutions.
- **Terraform**: Harnessing the power of infrastructure as code to tame the cloud.
- **Homelabbing**: Creating, breaking, and rebuilding home lab environments to push the boundaries of learning.

### Projects and Interests
I'm passionate about sharing my journey and insights through my blog, where I dive into topics like:
- **Automation tools and techniques**: From PowerShell modules to rest api's.
- **Scripting best practices**: Writing clean, efficient, and reusable code (or at least trying :D).
- **Microsoft Graph API**: Exploring advanced techniques for data manipulation and automation.
